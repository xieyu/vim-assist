Finder file in paths with regular expression

Attenion:
Change var paths to your own in plugin/Finder.vim function findFile, I know it's very Ugly to do this. 
May be I should read it from a file, or the global var defined in usr's .vimrc. not decide yet.

Useage:
 press <ctrl-f> to active the query, if find something,it  will show a output window that list the Found file path. 
 In output window, move to the line that you want open, press <Eneter> to hide the output window and show that File in last window. 
 <Space> 's behavior is same with <Enter> But keep the output window

TODO:
1. add options for query.
2. make it support find function or symbol.
